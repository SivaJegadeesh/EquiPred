# Predictive Maintenance System README

## Overview
This project implements a predictive maintenance system using machine learning techniques to predict equipment failures before they occur. The system collects sensor data from IoT devices, preprocesses the data, trains a machine learning model, and integrates it into a Flask web application for real-time monitoring. Additionally, the system includes features such as alert systems, interactive dashboards, and a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly (or Dash for dashboard development)
- Pickle

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
